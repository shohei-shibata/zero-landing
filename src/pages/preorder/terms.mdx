This Preorder / Reservation Agreement (these “Terms” or “Agreement”) governs the placing of a preorder / reservation (“Preorder”) with ZERO Turf Machines LLC (“ZTM” or “we” or “us”) for an Electric Fertilizer Spreader (“Spreader”). Please read all of these Terms carefully before submitting your Preorder. By submitting your Preorder, you agree to be legally bound by these Terms.
1. No Obligations
Each Preorder you submit for a GR-96 (“Spreader”) acts as a deposit for a future purchase of the Spreader. You are under no obligation to purchase a Spreader from us, and we are under no obligation to supply you with a Spreader.
These Terms do not constitute an agreement for the sale of a Spreader and do not lock in pricing, a firm production slot, or a firm delivery date. ZTM will notify preorder customers with instructions for completing the purchase, at a later date.
We may decline Preorders to avoid over-subscription or as we deem appropriate in our sole discretion. If your Preorder is declined, you will be notified and your Preorder payment will be refunded.
2. Preorder Eligibility: Age and Residency; Entity Preorders
You must be at least 18 years of age and a resident of the United States to Preorder a Spreader. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that you are at least 18 years of age and a resident of the United States. If you are Preordering a Spreader on behalf of a company, organization or entity (an “Entity”) located in the United States, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that Entity to these Terms and such Entity agrees to be bound by these Terms.
3. Registration
When placing a Preorder for a Spreader, you represent and warrant that all information provided is accurate, and it is your responsibility to keep this information current at any time by emailing {salesEmail}. ZTM shall not be liable for inaccurate or outdated information.
4. Payment
You will be charged the fee indicated (the “Preorder Fee”) when you place your Preorder. Placing a Preorder constitutes your express agreement to be charged the Preorder Fee using your provided payment method. 
5. No Guarantee of Delivery Date
We will endeavor to produce Your Selected Spreader in the future and your priority will be set by the date of payment of your Preorder Fee, our manufacturing schedule, our delivery and service operations availability and execution of the Final Sales Agreement. There is no guarantee as to delivery date based on your Preorder.
6. Cancellation/Refund
You may cancel your Preorder and receive a full refund of your Preorder Fee at any time by sending an email to {salesEmail} from the address you used to make the preorder or an updated address you have added to your ZTM account by contacting {salesEmail}. ZTM may cancel your Preorder at any time and will issue a full refund of your Preorder Fee to the address on file.
7. Spreader Specifications and Battery Range
You understand that we may not have completed the development of the Spreader or begun manufacturing the Spreader at the time of your Preorder and specifications are subject to change at any time. You understand battery range and other available features have not yet been determined and may change. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that you understand that the Spreader specifications may change prior to execution of any Final Sales Agreement.
8. Privacy Policy and Terms of Use
The data ZTM and/or its affiliates collects from you or about Your Selected Spreader will be used in accordance with our Privacy Policy and General Terms, each of which is incorporated herein by reference and available on our website at [{siteUrl}/privacy](/privacy) and [{siteUrl}/terms](/terms). Please read our Privacy Policy and General Terms carefully to understand the data that we collect and our practices regarding your information and how it will be treated. If you have questions regarding our Privacy Policy or General Terms, you should contact us by email at {salesEmail}.
9. Force Majeure
The obligations of you and ZTM under this Agreement (other than your payment obligations) will be suspended to the extent that such party is wholly or partially precluded from complying with its obligations under this Agreement by force majeure. Force majeure includes, but is not restricted to, fire, storm, flood, earthquake, explosion, accident, act of the public enemy, war, rebellion, insurrection, sabotage, outbreak, epidemic, public health emergency, quarantine restriction, labor dispute, labor shortage, transportation embargo or failure, curtailment or delay in transportation, act of God, act (including laws, regulations, orders, advisories, disapprovals or failure to approve) of any government or public health agency or authority, whether national, statewide, municipal, or otherwise, or any other event or circumstance beyond such party’s control.
10. Severability
If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision, or portion of this Agreement, to be unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and the unenforceable provision shall be deemed to be modified solely to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
11. Modification
This Agreement may not be modified, altered or amended unless expressly agreed to in writing signed by ZTM.
12. No Waivers
The failure by ZTM to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of ZTM.
13. Assignment
You may not assign your rights under these Terms without our express prior consent. ZTM may assign these Terms or your Preorder Fee in our discretion without your consent. Any assignment in violation of this Agreement will be null and void.
14. No Resellers; Discontinuation; Cancellation; Non-Export 
ZTM and its affiliates may unilaterally cancel any order that we believe has been made with the intent to resell the Spreader or otherwise has been made in bad faith. ZTM may also cancel your order if a Spreader, product, feature, or option is discontinued after you place your order.
The Spreader is intended for use only in the country where the Spreader is sold by ZTM to you, and service will be limited or unavailable outside of that country. You agree that you will not directly or indirectly export, or assist or facilitate the export of, this Spreader to a country where the Unites States has imposed trade restrictions.
15. Limitation of Liability
No Consequential or Indirect Damages. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL ZTM OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS AND PARTNERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR ENHANCED DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF (A) WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE; (B) WHETHER OR NOT A PROPOSED DEFENDANT WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES; AND (C) THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.
Maximum Liability. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL ZTM’S OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS AND PARTNERS AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE TOTAL OF THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID TO ZTM PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT.
16. Dispute Resolution—Arbitration AND Class Action Waiver
Binding Arbitration. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and except for small claims or if you choose to opt-out as provided below, this Section governs all Disputes between you and ZTM. The term “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced and means any dispute, demand, claim, or controversy of any kind between you and ZTM, whether based in contract, tort, statute, or otherwise, including but not limited to any claim for fraud, false advertising, misrepresentation, strict products liability, negligence, breach of contract, breach of express or implied warranties, or violations of consumer protection, privacy or data security laws, that arises out of or in any way relates to (1) this Agreement; (2) our relationship (including any such relationship with affiliate third parties who did not sign this Agreement); (3) the purchase, sale, condition, design, or manufacturing of the Spreader; (4) ZTM products or services; (5) advertising and other communications between you and ZTM; and as applicable, (6) your credit application. You and ZTM agree to resolve all Disputes by binding arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, unless you and we agree otherwise. For more information on arbitration and to access the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, please visit: www.adr.org. If the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules conflict with this Agreement, then this Agreement shall control. You and we understand that we are both waiving our rights to go to court (other than small claims court, as provided below), to present our claims to a jury and to have claims resolved by a jury trial, and also that judicial appeal rights, if any, are more limited in arbitration than they would be in court.  
Confidentiality. Arbitrations conducted under this Section shall be kept strictly confidential. Neither you or ZTM may disclose the fact that an arbitration exists or is proceeding, the nature or content of the Dispute(s), all documents exchanged in connection with the arbitration, all testimony (including transcripts of testimony, if any) that is given in the arbitration proceeding, or the results of any arbitration award. This paragraph shall not prevent disclosure of the arbitration proceedings: (1) as may be required by law or court order; (2) as may be required to judicially challenge or enforce an arbitration award; (3) as may be required to assist your or ZTM’s legal counsel, financial advisors, or accountants—provided that such individuals are also bound by this Section; (4) as may be required to disclose to existing or future shareholders, existing or potential insurers or reinsurers, existing or potential investors, existing or potential lenders, or existing or potential purchasers; or (5) if you and ZTM provide prior written consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this paragraph shall not apply to claims where confidentiality clauses are made illegal under state or federal law. The arbitrator shall have jurisdiction to hear any disputes over a breach of this Section and shall have authority to fashion an appropriate remedy. The arbitrator shall retain jurisdiction to enforce this Section after arbitration has ended.  
Initial Dispute Resolution Requirement. Most disputes can be resolved without resort to arbitration or small claims court. For any Dispute, you and we agree that before taking any formal action to initiate arbitration or a small claims suit we will contact the other in an attempt to resolve the Dispute. You will contact us at {siteUrl}/contact and provide a brief, written description of the Dispute and your contact information. We will contact you at your contact information on file with ZTM. You and ZTM agree to use reasonable efforts to settle any Dispute directly and good faith negotiations shall be a pre-condition to either party initiating a small claims suit or arbitration. 
Filing a Demand for Arbitration. If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of 60 days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, you must file an arbitration demand with AAA. You can find information about AAA and file your arbitration demand at https://www.adr.org/Support. You are also required to send a copy of the arbitration demand to us and you should send it by email to: {arbitrationEmail}.
Fees & Costs.  AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules will govern the allocation of arbitration fees and costs between you and ZTM. However, if your arbitration case filing fee exceeds the filing fee you would pay to file the action in a court of law, ZTM will pay the amount of your case filing fee in excess of the filing fee you would pay in a court of law. The amount we pay may be reimbursed in whole or in part by decision of the arbitrator if s/he finds that applicable law allows such reimbursement because your claims were frivolous or brought in bad faith. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless applicable law provides otherwise. 
Arbitration Location and Procedure. Arbitration shall be initiated and take place in the city or county of your residence unless you and ZTM agree otherwise, or, if you reside outside of the United States, in Clermont County, Ohio. If your claim does not exceed $25,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and ZTM submit to the arbitrator. If your claim exceeds $25,000, you and ZTM may agree to conduct arbitration by videoconference or teleconference or conduct a document-only arbitration without any hearing. The arbitrator will have discretion to require a telephonic or face-to-face hearing for any claim upon the request of a party.  
Applicable Law. You and ZTM agree that both the substantive and procedural provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”), shall govern the subject matter, formation, procedure, and enforcement of this Section. The statute of limitations laws, including statutes of repose, of the State in which the selling ZTM dealership on the first page of this Agreement is located, without regard to choice or conflict of law principles, will apply to any claims brought in arbitration.
Arbitrator’s Powers. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Section, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Section is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall also have exclusive authority to resolve all threshold issues of arbitrability, including whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration, issues relating to whether this Section is applicable, unconscionable, or illusory, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel. However, the parties agree that any issue concerning the validity of the class action waiver below must be decided by a court, and an arbitrator does not have authority to consider the validity of the waiver. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available to you in your individual capacity in a court under law or in equity, including public injunctive relief. The arbitrator’s award shall be written and shall be binding on you and ZTM. To preserve the confidentiality of the arbitration proceedings, the arbitrator’s award shall not be entered as judgment in a court of law, unless you or ZTM fail to voluntarily satisfy the arbitration award within sixty (60) days after the arbitration award has been rendered.
Class Action Waiver. The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in each party’s respective individual capacity only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND ZTM AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, NEITHER YOU NOR ZTM WILL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST OTHER CONSUMERS IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIM AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. If a court (after exhaustion of all appeals) declares any of this Class Action Waiver unenforceable, then all other aspects of the case must be arbitrated first. After completing arbitration, the remaining (non-arbitrable) aspects of the case will then be decided by a court.
Small Claims Court. Subject to the Initial Dispute Resolution Requirement, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court consistent with the jurisdictional limits that apply to that forum. 
Opt-Out Right. You may opt-out of this Section 16, Dispute Resolution – Arbitration and Class Action Waiver within 30 days from the date you place your Preorder, by sending an email to {optoutEmail} from the email associated with your ZTM Account with “Opt-Out of Arbitration” in the subject line and, in the body of the email, your full name and address. Any opt-out of this provision does not affect the validity of any other arbitration agreement between you and ZTM. If you opt out of this provision and at the time you sign this Agreement you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate disputes with ZTM, that existing arbitration agreement will remain in full force and effect.
Severability. If any arbitrator or court determines that any part of this Section 16, Dispute Resolution – Arbitration and Class Action Waiver is illegal or unenforceable, then such part will be eliminated and the remainder of Section 16, Dispute Resolution – Arbitration and Class Action Waiver will remain in force and effect and the unenforceable part shall be deemed to be modified solely to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
Survival. This Section 16, Dispute Resolution – Arbitration and Class Action Waiver shall survive the end of this Agreement and/or your relationship with ZTM, including the end of any promotion or contest, opt-out of communication or other use or participation in any ZTM Product or Service.
Choice of Forum. Any Dispute(s) deemed not subject to arbitration shall be litigated exclusively by either party in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. If the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any Dispute(s) deemed not subject to arbitration shall be litigated exclusively by either party in the Superior Court of the State of Ohio in the County of Clermont	.
By agreeing to this Preorder Agreement, you acknowledge and agree to the terms and conditions of this Section 16, Dispute Resolution – Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.
17. Choice of Law
This Agreement, its subject matter and its formation, and any related non-contractual disputes or claims, are governed by the laws of the State in which ZTM is licensed to sell motor Spreaders that is nearest to your delivery address, without regard to choice or conflict of law principles, except as otherwise provided in the Arbitration Agreement.  
18. Third Party Beneficiaries
ZTM, LLC’s subsidiaries and affiliates, including but not limited to ZTM Automotive, Inc. and ZTM Automotive, LLC, shall be entitled to rely upon, shall be express third party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to enforce, the provisions of these Terms, including without limitation, the Dispute Resolution – Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver.
19. Text Messages, Notifications, and Telephone Calls
By agreeing to this Agreement, you understand that by providing your wireless telephone number(s) now or in the future, you consent to being contacted at those numbers or addresses using prerecorded artificial voice messages and/or automatic telephone dial devices with non-marketing information about your Spreader, such as service reminders and appointments. You understand and agree that by providing your wireless telephone number you are consenting to receive calls or texts at that number. You also consent to receiving emails to any email address(es) you provide. You further understand and agree that these communications may contain your non-public information. You explicitly confirm that this consent covers the use of these contact methods to call or send text messages to the wireless telephone number(s) and to send text or email messages to the email address(es) you provide, for which you may incur a charge. Separately, we may seek your prior express written consent for marketing text messages or telephone calls.

20. Entire Agreement
Your Preorder confirmation, these Terms, our General Terms, and our Privacy Policy will be deemed the final and integrated agreement between you and us on the matters contained in these Terms. It shall supersede all prior and contemporaneous representations, warranties, agreements, understandings, inducements and conditions, express or implied, oral or written, of any nature whatsoever with respect to the subject matter hereof. In the event of any conflict between these Terms, our General Terms and our Privacy Policy, these Terms shall prevail.
