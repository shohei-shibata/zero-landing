## It's No Small Problem

With stand-behind zero-turn machines in general, we often hear people mention tip over accidents as a safety concern. They can cause significant damage not only to your equipment, but also to customer's property. The machines are often too heavy for one person to stand it back up.

If you run a lawn care service company, perhaps that's a concern that have you considering a smaller machine that will do less damange even if they are tipped over, even though they may offer less in terms of the spreading and spraying capabilities.

## Tip Over Warning

One major advantage of the GR96 over its competitors is that it has a built-in intertial measurement unit (IMU). An IMU basically measures the machine's orientation. In other words, the GR96 always knows how steep of a grade it is driving on. 

If you read the manual of any zero-turn spreader/sprayer, it will likely tell you that you should not drive the machine over a slope that is greater than 15 degrees. That's nice, but do you ever have a way of measuring grade while you are out doing application? We are guessing not!

That's why we included a Tip Over Warning feature with the GR96. If the GR96 is driving over a slope that is greater than 15 degrees, it will let you know. You will hear repeated beeps, and the LED indicator will blink until you return the machine to a more flat area. 

While this will not completely solve the tip over problem, we think that it can reduce tip over accidents significantly because most likely, those accidents happen when operators _don't realize_ that the slope is too steep for the machine to handle.
